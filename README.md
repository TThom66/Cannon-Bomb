# Cannon-Bomb
This is a game that I created in Python as a test of my skills in that language.

The objective is to defend your flower garden from incoming bomb strikes by using a cannon for as long as you can. This cannon moves side to side with the arrow keys and shoots with the spacebar. Should you obtain a highscore, you can enter your name with the arrow keys and press "enter" to confirm.

In order for the game to load correctly, you must have the following dependencies installed via pip:
1. Pygame
2. Numpy
3. Wave

The background music is the level theme of the Sega Genesis version of "Cheetahmen".
